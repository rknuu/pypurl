== PyPurl

PyPurl is a simple implementation of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PURL[Persistent URL (PURL)].

=== Why Another PURL Provider?

Presently, there's two major implementations for PURLs: 
- http://purlz.org/[Purlz] and its successor,
- http://callimachusproject.org/[Callimachus].

The problem with these implementations are:

. PURLz's development has ceased.
. Callimachus's goals are much larger than just PURLs.  They are focused on
  developing a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data[Linked Data]
  platform.

While I can appreciate the goals of Callimachus, there's a lot of additional
capability that isn't needed for a simple PURL provider.  Examples such as:
Semantic Web toolchain (Sesame), or a DocBook rendering engine, an XProc
implementation.

The goal of this project is to provide a clean-cut, easy-to-use, and Open PURL
web application built on Python technology.
